## Development

### Dependencies
- Node.js (Version >=10)
- gcc
- Xvfb (X Window Virtual Framebuffer)

### Build from source

1. Install NodeJS 10:

On Ubuntu, follow these instructions:

Install curl:

```sh
sudo apt install curl
```

The curl package is most likely installed by default. Then proceed to add the required repository and proceed:

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -`

Now, you may proceed with installing nodejs and build-essential packages:

`sudo apt install nodejs autoconf automake build-essential gcc g++ make rpm`


2. Clone the Repo:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/tuxedocomputers/tuxedo-fan-control
```

3. Enter the folder
```sh
cd tuxedo-fan-control
```

4. Install the Node dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

5. Build the Project:
```sh
npm run build
```

### Create Packages (deb, snap, AppImage, rpm, tar.gz)
```sh
npm run build && npm run pack
```

or for production environment:

```sh
npm run build:prod && npm run pack:prod
```

#### To install the derived packages:

You will find all artifacts under the `output/build` directory.
To install, for instance, on Ubuntu, run:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i output/build/*.deb
```

You can also use `gdebi` provided by `gdebi-core` for the same task:

```sh
sudo apt install gdebi-core
sudo gdebi output/build/*.deb
```
